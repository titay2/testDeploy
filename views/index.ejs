            <p class="lead">"A book lying idle on a shelf is wasted ammunition.
                Books must be kept in constant circulation.
                A book is not only a friend, it makes friends for you.
                When you have possessed a book with mind and spirit,
                you are enriched.
                But when you pass it on you are enriched threefold."</p>
